# Customer-Segment-Analysis-on-H&M-Group
This project involved analyzing customer segments for the H&amp;M Group. The goal was to identify and understand different customer segments based on various demographic and behavioral attributes.

**Segmentation Summary:-**

    - K-means Clustering: This machine learning algorithm was applied to identify distinct customer segments based on purchasing behavior and demographic data. By analyzing the clusters formed, we were able to group customers who exhibited similar buying patterns and demographic traits, allowing for more targeted marketing strategies.

    - Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA was used to reduce the dimensionality of the data, making it easier to visualize and interpret the customer segments. This technique helped in transforming the high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space, while retaining most of the variance in the data, which facilitated clearer cluster visualization.

    - Cluster Profiling: A detailed analysis of each cluster was conducted to understand the unique characteristics and preferences of each customer segment. This involved examining the demographic attributes, purchasing behaviors, and transaction patterns within each cluster, providing deeper insights into what drives the purchasing decisions of different customer groups.


**Data Used for Analysis:**

    1) Customers: Demographic data such as age, gender, and location.
    2) Products: Information about the products purchased, including categories, prices, and brands.
    3) Transactions: Detailed records of customer purchases, including transaction dates, amounts spent, and items bought.
